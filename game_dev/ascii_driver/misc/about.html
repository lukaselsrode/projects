        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p1>I recently watched the Tetris Movie (2023). I liked that the movie showed how the original conception of tetris 
            only used the ascii characters of '[]' to make up the main tetra blocks that comprised all of the functional units of the game-world. A portion of the movie, showed the protagonists 
            in a high-speed car chase with the KGB through the streets of Moscow. That portion of the movie then flickered back and forth between realtiy 
            and an ascii character video game representation of the chase sequence. Part of me went "ah-ha! what a neat little concept for a toy-ascii game", I went hunting throgh the interwebs and while 
            old-school 8/16-bit racers  like pole-position were a plenty I was amiss to find anything that had that classic ascii style that might be classified as an "ascii racer", so I made one. I challenged myself 
            to write everything in the game from scratch and really on as few packages as possible, in the same spirit in which the original Tetris was written.

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <h4>Main Game-Loop</h4>
        <p1>My primary gameplay loop-function was nothing fancy but writting it myself this is what I came up with working from this guide ...</p1>
        <div class="box">
                <pre>

        def game():
            road,user_stdin,start_time=Road(),KeyListner(),time.time()
            while True:
                curr_time = time.time()
                process_inputs(user_stdin,road),update(road),render(road,curr_time,start_time)
                
                </pre>
        </div> 
        <p1>From which I was able to get the backend functionally sound. I had written the application, now I needed to make it cl</p1>

        <p2>This year I "semi-un-oficially?" dropped out of the job-market to focus on my recovery. This project in many ways has helped me re-connect with why I fell in love with programming. Video Games are fun, engagin vitual experiences. It feel good to be making something tangible, rewarding,and stimulating. Still I am maintaning this site pro-bono as a solo-developer and would appreciate any coin you might be able to contribute to me mainitaing the site for future-use.</p2>
