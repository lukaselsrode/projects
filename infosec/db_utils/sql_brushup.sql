/* Out-of-Band SQL INJECTIONS:

 ~ Generally, these SQL injections will cause the database server to send HTTP or DNS requests containing SQL query results to an attacker-controlled server. From there, the attacker could review the log files to identify the query results.
 
 Again, these injections are extremely difficult to execute. They rely on permissions to database functions that are most often disabled, and would have to bypass firewalls that might stop requests to the attackerâ€™s server.
