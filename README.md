# My Public Projects

An overview of all my public projects. I'm always open to job opportunities and contributing to projects I think have value. 
This repository is to demonstrate my programming proficiency. My main language is Python, but I am also comfortable writing in: 
C,Go,JavaScript,TypeScript,Bash. Always open to learning a new language and build "cool-stuff". I had another GitHub, but thought it'd be nice to start fresh with a new repository. 

## Project Overview

### Game Development - [COMPLETED]
Video Games are how I originally got into computers. I did not use any game-engines and wrote everything from source. 
- Various game development projects demonstrating core programming concepts

### Total Behavioral Tracker - [IN-PROGRESS - PLANNED REWRITE]
A mobile application to track your personalized 'daily program', a qualitative measurement of your current emotional and spiritual fitness based on personalized values, activities, goals, and motivators. The application also accounts for underlying mental-health conditions and potential substance abuse issues.

**Current Status**: Initially built with Kivy (Python), but planning to port to React Native or Flutter due to build process challenges with Kivy.

**Planned Improvements**:
- Migrate from Kivy to React Native or Flutter for better mobile development experience
- Streamline build and deployment process
- Improve UI/UX with native components
- Enhance performance and stability

### Daily Investor - [COMPLETED/TWEAKING]
Financial tools and scripts for investment tracking and analysis. Previously integrated with Robinhood API for automated trading and portfolio management.
