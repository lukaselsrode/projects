# My Public Projects

An overview of all my public projects. I'm always open to job opportunities and contributing to projects I think have value. 
This repository is to demonstrate my programming proficiency. My main language is Python, but I am also comfortable writing in: 
C,Go,JS,Bash,HTML. Always open to learning a new language and build "cool-stuff". I had another GitHub, but thought it'd be nice to start fresh with a 
new repository as I get back into the job-market. 

## Project Overview

### Game Development - [COMPLETED]
Video Games are how I originally got into computers. I did not use any game-engines and wrote everything from source. 

### Total Behavioral Tracker - [IN-PROGRESS]
A mobile application built in Kivy to track your personalized 'daily program', a qualitative measurement of your current emotional and spiritual fitness based on personalized values, activities, goals, and motivators. The application also accounts for underlying mental-health conditions and potential substance abuse issues.  

### Fintech - [DEPRECATED/OLD]
My background is in DevOps in the fin-tech sector. I was writing a few test libraries to hookup to my RobinHood account to their API. 
I haven't worked on this project in over a year, so don't get mad if most of this is deprecated. 

### Sys-Admin
Some Shell Scripts I run on my personal machine to keep everything up-to-date and orderly. Getting rid of repetitive work is the reason why I got into programming. 

### Infosec
Intellectual curiosity killed the cat, so naturally I like red-teaming systems. Mostly learning material. A few custom networking utilities. 

### Misc
Some scripts that don't fit into any of my projects that I've found helpful to keep on-hand.


### Up-Skilling
self education materials, the moment you stop growing is the moment you start dying.
